A **Class Library** is a project that contains types and methods used by applications. The compiled result of a class library is a **Dynamic Link Library (DLL)**.

## Creating a New Project

Creating a Class Library project follows the [same steps as a Console Application]({{ site.url }}{{ site.baseurl }}/docs/intro-to-dotnet-csharp-vs/console-application-project/#create-a-new-project), except that you will choose a different project template.

When you get to the **Create a new project** window, the project type you want to choose is called "Class Library (.NET Framework)". You can use the search to filter the list.

## Solution File Structure

If you navigate to the location you created the project to, youâ€™ll find the solution directory for the project you created.

At this point you may have more than one Visual Studio solution stored in this location. Read the directories careful to determine the one you are looking for.

### Solution Directory

The solution directory contains:

* **Project Directory** - You will see one directory for each project in the solution. New solutions will only contain one project and thus will have one project directory.
* **Solution File (.sln)** - A file that ends with the file extension .sln. The .sln file contains information the Visual Studio environment needs to find and load the solution's associated projects and resources.

### Project Directory

The project directory contains:

* **bin Directory** - Contains binary files. These are the application or library assemblies generated during a successful project build.
* **obj Directory** - Contains compiled binary files that haven't been linked yet and will later be combined to produce the assembly file stored in the _bin_ directory.
* **Properties Directory** - Contains information about the project. This information can viewable and editable in Visual Studio.
* **MS Build File (.csproj) File** - The MSBuild file for the Visual Studio project.
* **Class1.cs** - This file contains a class called `Class1` and is created by default because of the project template that was chosen when creating the project.

`Class1` is not an appropriate name for a class. You should rename this file and the class identifier within it.

## Visual Studio Solution Explorer

[![Solution Explorer](../images/class-libraries/solution-explorer.png "Solution Explorer"){: .large }](../images/class-libraries/solution-explorer.png)

When the newly created class library project is loaded into Visual Studio, the Solution Explorer will contain the following:

* **Properties** - This node can be ignored.
* **References** - This node contains the project references to other class libraries.
* **Class1.cs** - The source code file _Class1.cs_ that contains the `Class1` class.

## Building the Project

[Building (Compile) a Project]({{ site.url }}{{ site.baseurl }}/docs/intro-to-dotnet-csharp-vs/visual-studio-ide/#building-compiling-a-project) was discussed in a previous topic.

On a successful build of a Console Application Project, the following files will be generated in the **bin\Debug** directory within the Project directory.

[![Debug Directory](../images/class-libraries/debug-directory.png "Debug Directory"){: .large }](../images/class-libraries/debug-directory.png)

The files you see in the screenshot above are:

* **Dynamic Link Library File (.dll)** - The assembly file, which is the compiled version of your project.
* **Program Database File (.pdb)** - The program database file that contains debugging information about the library. You can ignore this file.
