## Input / Output Streams

In C# a stream is an abstract representation of a device on which input and output operations can be performed.

The devices which we can stream to and from are things like the operating systemâ€™s standard output (console), standard input (keyboard), and the file system.

You can think of a stream as a source or a destinations for a potentially unlimited sequence of bytes.

The `System.Console` class is a class that represents the standard input, output and error streams for console applications. The Console class is used for all input and output to the console.

## Output Text To the Console

In Java, to output text to the console you needed to reference the standard output stream by using `System.out`. In C#, you can accomplish the same by using the `Console` class.

```csharp
Console.Out
```

The `Out` class member returns a reference to a `TextWriter` object. The `TextWriter` class has two method for outputting text to a stream:

* `Write()`
* `WriteLine()`

`Write()` is equivalent to Java's `java.io.PrintStream.print()` method and `WriteLine()` is equivalent to Java's `java.io.PrintStream.println()`.

```csharp
Console.Out.Write("This will output without a line break. ");
Console.Out.WriteLine("This will output with a line break.");
```

Output:

```text
This will output without a line break. This will output with a line break.
```

These output operations can be simplified by using the `Write()` and `WriteLine()` methods of the `Console` class.

```csharp
string name = "Chris";

Console.Write("Hello, ");
Console.WriteLine(name + "!");
Console.WriteLine("Today is going to be a great day!");
```

Output:

```text
Hello, Chris!
Today is going to be a great day!
```

### Formatting Output

`Write()` and `WriteLine()` are overloaded methods, with versions that work like Java's `java.io.PrintStream.printf()` method.

```csharp
string name = "Chris";
DateTime date = DateTime.Now;
Console.WriteLine("Hello, {0}! Today is {1}, it's {2:HH:mm} now.", name, date.DayOfWeek, date);
```

Output:

```text
Hello, Chris! Today is Tuesday, it's 11:14 now.
```

The curly-braces ({}) signifies a placeholder. The integer value within the placeholder signifies an index used to reference the arguments after the string argument. Formatting strings like this is called [Composite Formatting](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/standard/base-types/composite-formatting){: target="_blank" }.

## Reading From the Console

The `Console` class can also be used for reading input from the console using the `Read()` and `ReadLine()` methods. `Read()` will read the next character from the stream and `ReadLine()` reads an entire line of data from the stream.

```csharp
Console.Write("(Y/N)? ");

char choice = Console.ReadLine()[0];

Console.WriteLine(choice);

Console.Write("Enter your full name: ");

string fullname = Console.ReadLine();

Console.WriteLine(fullname);
```

Output:

```text
(Y/N)? y
y
Enter your full name: Kenny Omega
Kenny Omega
```

The `Console.In` class member returns a `TextReader` object. Using `Console.In` is not required when you use `Console.Read()` and `Console.ReadLine()`.
