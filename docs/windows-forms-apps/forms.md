### Design Standards

For Windows Forms App projects where you are given a design for the forms, the expectation is that you will create form designs that will match the requirements you are given. The requirements will be in the form of both a image and/or text descriptions.

The expectation of your form designs will not require you to generate an exact pixel-to-pixel copy, but rather, a form that has no noticeable differences between what you develop and what the requirement is.

To give you a better idea of the expectations, consider the design requirement below, and the designs completed by past students.
