# Events

The section will help you answer the following questions:

* How can I reserve a part of my code to be implemented by someone else at a later time?
* Is it possible to store a method, like I can with other data types?
* How can object's interact more efficiently?

## Learning Objectives

* Declare and use a Delegate.
* Develop classes that are defined with events.
* Develop an application that handles an object's event.
