<p>C# (pronounced “see sharp”) is a modern Object-Oriented Programming language. It is one of the most popular of the programming languages supported by the .NET.</p>

<p>C# is a C-based language. It’s syntax is influenced by other languages like C, C++, and Java. If you are comfortable developing in either of the aforementioned languages, you can already read C# code.</p>

<p>Here is an example of the traditional “Hello World” program written in C#:</p>

<div class="language-csharp highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code><span class="k">using</span> <span class="nn">System</span><span class="p">;</span>

<span class="k">namespace</span> <span class="nn">ADEV.BIT.ADEV.RRC.Module1</span>
<span class="p">{</span>
    <span class="k">internal</span> <span class="k">class</span> <span class="nc">Program</span>
    <span class="p">{</span>
        <span class="k">static</span> <span class="k">void</span> <span class="nf">Main</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="kt">string</span><span class="p">[]</span> <span class="n">args</span><span class="p">)</span>
        <span class="p">{</span>
            <span class="n">Console</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="nf">WriteLine</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="s">"Hello World"</span><span class="p">);</span>
            <span class="n">Console</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="nf">Write</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="s">"Press any key to continue..."</span><span class="p">);</span>
            <span class="n">Console</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="nf">ReadKey</span><span class="p">();</span>
        <span class="p">}</span>
    <span class="p">}</span>
<span class="p">}</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>As you can see from the sample code above, C# has a very similar syntax to Java. Many of the keywords are the same. Some of the words are different, but based on context, you should have a good understanding what they represent.</p>

<p>More often than not, the syntax you used to develop Java code will work in C#. The following will highlight the similarities and differences from Java.</p>
